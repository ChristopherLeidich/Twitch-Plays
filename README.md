# TwitchPlays
These are the three Python files I use that allows Twitch Chat or Youtube Chat to control your keyboard or mouse to play a game. You are welcome to use or adapt this code for your own content.
The Current Version can only do that. I intend to modify it to be able to Spawn things in. I am Currently thinking of modifying the code to be used for Cyberpunk 2077. Please Stay Tuned until further Notice.

## :memo: Status

🟢 ongoing

## :heavy_check_mark: Prerequisites
To run the code you will need to install Python 3.9 or newer.  
Additionally, you will need to install the following python modules using Pip:

```bash
pip install keyboard

## Note to Potential Readers

Once Python is set up, simply change the Twitch username (or Youtube channel ID) in TwitchPlays_TEMPLATE.py, and you'll be ready to go.

This is the Version made by DougDoug. I will Modify it further for my own purposes however. If you want to use this code please visit DougDougs [Version](https://github.com/DougDougGithub/TwitchPlays).

This code is originally based off Wituz's Twitch Plays template, then expanded by DougDoug and DDarknut with help from Ottomated for the Youtube side. For now I am not reviewing any pull requests or code changes, this code is meant to be a simple prototype that is uploaded for educational purposes. But feel free to fork the project and create your own version!
